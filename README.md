I'm Harsh, a web developer based in India.
I build scalable RESTful APIs, microservices, and real-time systems, with a strong emphasis on debugging and system design fundamentals.

I am developing a Video Streaming Platform, a scalable system designed for adaptive HLS streaming. My recent work involves implementing background job processing with BullMQ and Redis, containerizing services with 
Docker, and optimizing content delivery using Cloudflare R2.

Tools and tech I use-
Core Stack: JavaScript, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB.
Tools: Docker, Linux, FFmpeg, Cloudflare R2, Git, Postman

I have got a bunch of pinned projects but my favourite is Retro URL (https://github.com/harshsinghdev-11/url_check) (where I reduced API latency by 99.93% using Bloom Filters).

I maintained 35 repos that include both pubic and private.

Fun Facts:
Tea or coffee fuelled,
Money Heist is my favourite show.
